        My husband and I were married here on July 15, 2017. To say that our wedding was everything we imagined it would be is an understatement. It was the absolute perfect day, and we have the staff at StoneBridge to thank for that. Not only is the house beautiful, but the scenery and backdrop is amazing. The reception tent is elegant and beautifully decorated, which left me with very little to decorate myself. Leah was our coordinator and took our stress away! She coordinated rehearsal, as well as the day of the wedding. She made sure we were completely taken care of, everything AND everyone was in the right spot, and everything went according to plan. She was a tremendous help and the day went so smoothly. I would HIGHLY recommend this as your wedding venue or any other special event you may have coming up! Price is extremely reasonable as well.</p>

      <p class="card-text">So breathtaking! As you pull up to the manor and park the car to begin unloading and setting up, STOP!...take a deep breath...look around at the majestic scenery... listen to the sounds of nature , not the highway, not the horns, its overwhelming to stand there knowing that your just about to make your daughters dream come true in the most magical place we have seen. Thats when it hits you and you cry with astounding joy. Thanks to Stonebridge for their help in making this day magical for our daughter, Sincerely Mr. & Mrs. Boswell</p>

      <p class="card-text">As an event planner myself, I was excited to see what Stonebridge had to offer. On July 22nd we held my parents 40th Anniversary party at the venue. From the moment I stepped on the grounds I was blown away. The view, the house, the immaculate detail that was put into the setting, was amazing. To then hear from my parents and owner, Shauna, what was included in the rental..I was even more taken aback! I live in Sarasota Florida where destinations weddings and events are in high demand. I've planned birthdays, weddings and corporate events. I can confidently say that no venue I've ever worked with has ever offered as much as Shauna and her staff do. To have not only the entire venue, but chairs, tables, linens AND that stunning tent, is unheard of in the event world! The pricing for the venue doesn't even begin to cover the value of the entire experience you will have of you choose Stonebridge for your venue. A million kudos to Shauna and staff for finally providing Cumberland with a high quality, beautiful, scenic event space! Thank you for helping make my mom and dad's night unforgettable!</p>
